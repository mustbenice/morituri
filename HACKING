unicode
-------
- All text files should be read and written as unicode.
- All strings that came from the outside should be converted to unicode objects.
- Use asserts liberally to ensure this so we catch problems earlier.
- All gst.parse_launch() pipelines should be passed as utf-8; use
  encode('utf-8')
- morituri.extern.log.log is not unicode-safe; don't pass it unicode objects;
  for example, always use %r to log paths
- run with RIP_DEBUG=5 once in a while to catch unicode/logging errors.
- Also use unicode prefix/suffix in tempfile.* methods; to force unicode.
- filesystems on Unix do not have an encoding.  file names are bytes.
  However, most distros default to a utf-8 interpretation
- You can either treat paths as byte strings all the way without interpreting
  (even when writing them to other files), or assume utf-8 on in and out.
- also direct output to a file; redirection sets codec to ASCII and brings out
  unicode bugs
